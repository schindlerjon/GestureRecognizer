GestureRecognizer
=================

-- This program is a compilation of work from Trey Roady and Jonathan Schindler under the Texas A&M Human Factors and Cognitive Studies Lab in the Department of Industrial Engineering. It utilizes a pre-made wiimote library and the $1 Gesture Recognizer (both which can easily be found online). Please respect the agreements of these sources as you view or use this program. --

This is a simple console-based program which prompts the user via command line.


The user is able to:
- Define new gesture templates
- Add additional samples to each template for more reliable data
- Edit old Gestures
- Print the current templates
- Load a set of templates
- Save the current set of templates
- Compare(Score) real-time Gestures to templates



Some of the constraints in which we wanted were:
- ~95% correct gesture recognition rates
- ~< 1.0 second response rate for scoring
- Ability to distinguish gestures oriented in similar manners



Eventually we will also look into ways of expanding the $1 Gesture recognizer into a three-dimensional space accurately without sacrificing any of our constraints.
